# Machine-Learning-Labwork
Machine learning explores how computers learn from data without explicit programming, combining core theory with hands-on implementation of modern algorithms. This course introduces supervised learning, neural networks, deep learning, and best practices, with real-world applications in vision, robotics, medical informatics, and audio.
